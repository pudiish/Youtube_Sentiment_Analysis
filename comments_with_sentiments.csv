"The scary thing about the zombies in this video is that they behave identical to humans, just with the intent to kill for the sake of killing. <br>Usually, zombies are portrayed as mindless creatures who have lost their human-alikeness (i know that&#39;s not really a word) but in this case, you can see they are smart. And they behave just as humans do, only that they are disfigured and that they seem to want to murder just for the purpose of murdering (or do they?).<br>Notice how they sneak around? Notice how the one going for Trippie after he trips (lul) on that axe was planning on doing something else, then notices my dude is defenseless and instead DECIDES to go for an easy kill?<br>That&#39;s crazy. <br>Their movement is 100% human. The actors were portraying humans, moving not like zombies do but like humans do, just wearing masks and make-up that makes them &quot;non-human&quot;.",-0.12804232804232804

"Dungeons of memory revive felonies, <br>Sly enemies, and therapies. Die, melodies <br>Of cries! Jealousy is an arrow of hate. <br>Swallow blades of sorrow. Date with harrowed Fate. <br>Follow baits. Crullers fade. Gunners jade my daughter <br>Whoring for a hundred dollars. Dog collars <br>And squalor. Coppers hump her. Dishonor <br>Discolors father. Decrepitude wrecking you <br>When soldiers stab her boob. Fellas groove <br>And boot her for ineptitude and rectitude <br>She tries to show. Another blow. Snow <br>Stuffed in her nose make her glow. You know… <br>She is happy and scrappy. Snappy chappies <br>Treat her like a puppy. Sobbing and blowj…bbing. <br>Soldiers fry her shoulders. She’ll never get older. <br>She molders. Soldiers eat her on the colter. <br>Mourn her. Behold her bones on the boulders. <br>You sold her not to smolder. You can’t unfasten <br>Knots. Assassins show no compassion.
